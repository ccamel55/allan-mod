# Allan mod
Fabric mod that contains some quality of life features that I like to have when playing.
There are also some weird and stupid features that I have made for the fun of it.

### Configuration
Right now everything is done using chat commands however in the future, a custom click gui 
or a tab gui at the least will be implemented.

## Note!
Some features are considered "cheats" by most people, therefore there is a global toggle to 
enable cheat mode which also prevents you from joining any multiplayer servers.

## Technical/backend things to do
- Parameter system for modules
- Better config system
- Keybinding system
- Custom OpenGL Renderer?

## Currently Implemented
- Fulbright
- Toggle Sprint

## To do
- Read Display
- Tnt Timer
- Co-ordinates
- Direction
- Fps
- Ping
- TPS
- CPS
- Keystrokes
- Block overlay
- Custom crosshairs
